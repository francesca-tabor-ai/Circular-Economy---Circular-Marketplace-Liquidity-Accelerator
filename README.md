# Circular Marketplace Liquidity Accelerator (CMLA)

The Circular Marketplace Liquidity Accelerator (CMLA) is a high-performance, AI-driven command center designed specifically for founders of circular economy marketplaces.

In emerging circular industries—such as EV battery second-life, industrial chemical recycling, or textile reclamation—the primary hurdle isn't just sustainability; it's liquidity. CMLA acts as an operational engine to help marketplaces move past the "chicken-and-egg" problem of supply and demand to reach consistent transaction volume.

## Core Modules

- **Marketplace Health Dashboard**: A real-time overview of critical liquidity metrics, including Supply Lock-in scores, Demand Coverage ratios, and Transaction Velocity.
- **AI Strategist**: An integrated insight engine powered by Gemini that analyzes current marketplace stats to provide high-priority, actionable interventions to clear bottlenecks.
- **Supply Engine & Lock-in Tracker**: A module focused on capturing and retaining early suppliers. It tracks "Lock-In Scores" to identify concentration risks and ensure a stable supply moat.
- **Demand Seeding Lab**: A dedicated pipeline management system for high-intent off-takers. It features segment-specific AI tactical generation for Enterprise, SME, and Direct buyers.
- **Visual Lab**: A professional asset generation suite using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. Founders can generate high-fidelity industrial photography to demonstrate "operational clarity" to enterprise partners and seed market trust.
- **Playbook Lab**: A high-end copy and logic generator that produces outbound sequences and internal operational playbooks to turn growth tactics into repeatable systems.

## The "Founder AI" Persona: Alex Voss

The app features a built-in conversational coach named Alex Voss, known as "The Systems Operator." Unlike typical friendly chatbots, Alex is direct, data-driven, and focused exclusively on operational excellence. He provides "Operational Probes"—context-aware questions that help founders diagnose their current liquidity gaps and execute ruthlessly.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React (TSX) with a clean, high-contrast "Industrial-Slate" aesthetic.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom "Stripe-inspired" gradients and typography.
- **Visualizations**: Recharts for tracking complex marketplace liquidity trends.
- **AI Backend**: Deep integration with the Google Gemini API for:
  - **Gemini 3 Pro**: For complex reasoning in the Playbook Lab.
  - **Gemini 3 Flash**: For real-time chat and high-speed data analysis.
  - **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**: For hyper-realistic industrial visual generation.

CMLA is designed for the "Systems Operator" founder who understands that circularity is an operational challenge, and liquidity is the only metric that guarantees survival.
